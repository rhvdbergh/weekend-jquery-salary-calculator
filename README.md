# jQuery Salary Calculator

## Description

Duration: Weekend Coding Project

This application records employee details, calculates the total monthly cost of their salaries, and displays it in a table on the page. Users can remove employees by clicking on their associated delete button; this will update the total monthly costs and the table in the browser window.

If the total monthly costs of employees' salaries exceeds $20,000, the "Total Monthly" and dollar amount at the end of the table will display a red background.

Behind the scenes, the information is stored in an array, with each employee being assigned a unique ID (regardless of the ID entered by the user).
